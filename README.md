# CNN-LSTM for Residential Energy Consumption Prediction

This project reproduces the key methodology and experiments from the paper  
**["Predicting residential energy consumption using CNN-LSTM neural networks"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.03.015)** published in *Energy* (2019).

We implement a hybrid **CNN-LSTM** deep learning architecture for multivariate, multi-step forecasting of residential electricity consumption, and evaluate its performance across various time granularities: **minute**, **hour**, **day**, and **week**.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Run the main notebook

You can launch the core notebook in your environment (local or Colab):

```bash
jupyter Notebook notebooks/energy_prediction.ipynb
```

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

The implemented model follows the original paper's architecture:

* **2D Convolutional layers**: To extract spatial patterns from multivariate features
* **LSTM layer**: To capture temporal dependencies across time steps
* **Dense layers**: For multi-step output forecasting

Three models are compared:

* Linear Regression (baseline)
* LSTM
* CNN-LSTM (hybrid)

Each is evaluated on RMSE across multiple time resolutions.
