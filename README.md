# CNN-LSTM for Residential Energy Consumption Prediction

This project is a reproduction of the paper *["Predicting residential energy consumption using CNN-LSTM neural networks"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.03.015)* published in *Energy (2019)*. It implements a hybrid deep learning model to forecast residential electricity consumption using historical time series data.
